## Folder containing pre-processed cellular spheroids: 
Here there should be 2 folders: `Training` and `Testing`, each of which contains 3 subfodlers inside `TP`, `ST`, and `CM`. The resulting directory layout is expected to look like:
```
Exp Dataset
    |____Training
    |       |____ TP
    |       |____ ST
    |       |____ CM
    |____Testing
    |       |____ TP
    |       |____ ST
    |       |____ CM
    |____README.md
```
